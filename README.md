# Indoor-localization-app
Uses Android and Firebase to find your location on a set of blueprints that you upload. The way it works is you upload blueprints to firebase
walk around keeping location in mind and scan all the wifi singals in a building to build a unique wifi location on your map.
Once achieved you can walk around and ask the App to find you and it will return your nearest stored location. Still very much in the early stages!
